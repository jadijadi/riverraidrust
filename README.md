# River Raid Rust

![Screenshot](/images/Screenshot.png)

## What is it

A rewrite of the classic game river raid, in Rust.
Also I am [screen casting](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFOYXCPEqdNXWsdP8orNI65uvmIwNxLbz&si=3YTF_XHaivJYfJfc) all of it. 

For fun and education.

## How to play

- The player `P` tries to stay inside the river while avoiding enemies `E`.
- Use `w`,`a`,`s`,`d` or (`↑`,`←`,`↓`,`→`) to move.
- Use `Space` to shoot them.
- Collect fuel `F` by passing through it or shoot it to get extra scores.

- You can pause the game by pressing `p` and exit by pressing `q`

Good Luck :thumbsup:

## Contributing

Because the development process is supposed to be streamed, you should raise an [Issue](https://github.com/jadijadi/riverraidrust/issues) before implementing any new feature.
If I find a feature to be sufficiently important, I may prefer to implement it myself during a recording, allowing the audience to observe the process and learn from it.
Thank you for understanding.
